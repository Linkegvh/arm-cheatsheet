###### Set the I2C operation to default (Clear AA, STA, EN by writing to I2CxCONCLR)
##### Step 2
###### Write 1 to STA bit of I2CxCONSET. Clear SI ( by writing to I2CxCONCLR). Wait for SI to be set (which can be checked by reading the CONSET register)
##### Step 3
###### Write the slave address (follow by WRITE bit) to I2CxDAT. Clear STA bit by writing to I2CxCONCLR. Clear SI. Wait for SI
##### Step 4
###### Write data to I2CxDAT. Clear SI. Wait for SI
* Remember that in TX mode, if the SI is set, it means the data is received and acknowledged by the slave

###### Write 1 to STA bit of I2CxCONSET for repeating the start condition. Clear SI. Wait for SI
##### Step 6
###### Write the slave address (follow by READ bit) to I2CxDAT. Clear STA bit by writing to I2CxCONCLR. Clear SI. Wait for SI

##### Step 9
###### Clear AA. Clear SI. Wait for SI
##### Step 10
###### Do reading 16 |= I2CxDAT to append the LSB. Clear SI. Wait for SI

###### Write 1 to a bit of this register to set the corresponding bit in the I2C control register
##### AA
###### Bit[2]
* Set 1
    * When more bytes are expected from the slave, this causes an acknowledge to be sent to the slave upon receiving a byte
* Set 0
    * When no more bytes are expected from the slave, this castes an NA to be sent to the slave upon receiving a byte
##### SI
###### Bit[3]
* Set 1

## UART
### Protocol
#### RX
##### SIPO
###### Check for start bit
###### After getting the start bit, sample at next bit time
* Store the data in shift register to put into FIFO
    * System get data out from FIFO
###### After receiving stop bit, check for start bit again
#### TX
##### PISO
###### Generate a start bit
###### Shifts the required number of data bits out to the line
###### Parity bit
###### Appends the stop bits
#### Stuff needs to know
##### Data line is default high
###### optional parity bit to check for data loss
##### Start bit
###### Logic 0
###### Lasts longer than half of a bit time
* Meaning more than 8 pulses
##### Stop bit
###### Logic 1
##### UART clock is running at a multiple (16) of data rate ==> each bit is 16 clock pulses
###### The receiver is always searching for start bit
###### If a start bit is received
* Wait for one bit and sample and put the content on shift register
##### UART Voltage
###### 3.3V
###### 0V
#### Character Framing
##### Start
###### DATA (LSB send first) (configurable amount of bits but usually 8)
* Optional parity bit
    * Stop
### Registers
#### UnRBR
##### Receive buffer register
###### Processor reads from UnRBR to extract the oldest character from the Rx FIFO
###### Reading UnRBR will remove the character from the Rx FIFO
#### UnTHR
##### Transmit holding register
###### Processor writes to UnTHR to insert the newest character into the Tx FIFO
###### The character is removed from the Tx FIFO when the RSR starts transmitting it
#### UnLCR
##### Line control register
###### Determines the format of data character to be transmitted or received
###### Bit
* 1:0
    * Word length select
* 2
    * Stop bit select
* 3
    * Parity enable
* 5:4
    * Parity select

* 7
    * Divisor latch access bit (DLAB)
* 32:8
    * Reserved
#### UnLSR
##### Line status register
###### Provides the status information on the UARTn Tx and Rx blocks
###### Bit
* 0
    * Receiver data ready (RDR)
* 1
    * Overrun error
        * When it happens, it means Rx FIFO is full and the data received in shift register will be overwrittened instead of saved
* 2
    * Parity error (PE)
        * When the parity bit of a received character is in the wrong state
* 3
    * Framing error (FE)
        * When the stop bit of a received character is a logic 0, a framing error occurs. 
* 4
    * Break interrupt (BI)
        * When RXDn is held in the spacing state (all zeros) for one full character transmission (start, data, parity, stop), a break interrupt occurs.
        * When this occurs, the receiver goes idle until RXDn goes to marking state (all ones)
        * UnLSR read clears this status bit
* 5
    * Transmitter holding register empty (THRE)
        * When the THR is empty
        * Clear on a UnTHR write
* 6
    * Transmitter empty (TEMT)
        * Set when both UnTHR and UnTSR are empty
        * Clear when either UnTSR or the UnTHR contain valid data
* 7
    * Error in Rx FIFO (RXFE)
        * When a character with a Rx error such as framing error, parity error or break interrupt, is loaded into the UnRBR. 
        * Clear when the UnLSR register is read and there are no subsequent errors in the UARTn FIFO
* 31: 8
    * Reserved
#### UnTER
##### Transmit enable register
###### Bits
* 6:0
    * Reserved
* 7
    * TXEN
        * When 1
            * Data written to the THR is output on the TXD pin as soon as any preceding data has been sent.
        * When 0
            * Means the character is sent and more further sending will happen till it becomes 1
    * Flow control
        * Devices let each other know when they are ready to accept data
            * If want data
                * XON (0X11) character
                    * Set the TXEN
            * If do not want more data
                * XOFF (0x13) character
                    * Clear the TXEN to stop transmission
### Transmission
#### RX
##### UART_ReceiveData
###### Check if the UnRBR has got data inside through checking the line status register for RDR
###### If has
* Arr[i] = LPC_UART0 -> RBR & 0xFF
    * The smart way is to use a pointer instead of a physical passed in array
###### If does not have
* If has time out
    * Wait
    * If time out
        * Break
* If does not have time out
    * Break
#### TX
##### UART_SendData
###### Check if the THR is empty by checking LSR -> THRE
###### If it is empty
* Send in FIFO size amount of data
    * LPC_UART0 -> THR = Arr[i]& 0xFF
        * The smarter way to do this is to use a point instead of a physical passed in array
###### If it is not empty
* If got time out
    * Wait
    * If time out
        * Break
* If does not have time out
    * Break

###### The names of the core exception vectors
###### A common way to access peripheral registers
###### A common way to define exception vectors
###### Thus, we just need to specify the ports and pins that we want to access. The CMSIS functions will retrieve the address of that peripheral register by itself
