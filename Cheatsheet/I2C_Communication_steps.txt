I2C Communication steps (RX):
    1. Set I2C operation to default by disable the I2C interface (clear AA, STO, enable bit)
            I2CxCONCLR = 1100100; or I2CxCONCLR = (1 << 6) | (1 << 5) | (1 << 2);
    2. Enable the interface
            I2CxCONSET = (1 << 6);
    3. Set the STA bit, so that the start bit will be sent after the SI bit is cleared
            I2CxCONSET = (1 << 5);
    4. Clear the SI bit, so that the start bit could be sent
            I2CxCONCLR = (1 << 3);
    5. Wait for the SI bit to become 1, this will indicate the previous transmission is complete
            check (I2CxCONSET >> 3) % 0x01 == 1?
    6. Write the slave address to Data register to send out
            I2CxDAT = slave address + "1";
    7. Clear the SI bit to send out the Data
            I2CxCONCLR = (1 << 3);
    8. Wait for the SI
            check (I2CxCONSET >> 3) % 0x01 == 1?
    9. Clear the STA bit, otherwise a repeating start will be sent // we do not want that as we have yet to receive any thing really)
            I2CxCONCLR = (1 << 5);
    10. Set AA to get ACK ready to be sent immediately when the one byte data is received
            I2CxCONSET = (1 << 2);
    11. Clear SI, to proceed further for the slave to send the data
            I2CxCONCLR = (1 << 3);
    12. Wait for the SI
            check (I2CxCONSET >> 3) % 0x01 == 1?
    13. Read data from the data register
            retrive data from I2CxDAT

if we are going to receive one more byte

    14. Clear AA, to get ready to send NACK after received the last byte
            I2CxCONCLR = (1 << 2);
    15. - 17. Repeat 11. - 13.
    18. Set STO to get stop bit ready
            I2CxCONSET = (1 << 4);
    19. Clear SI, so that the stop bit will be sent and the data transmission is terminated
            I2CxCONCLR = (1 << 3);
